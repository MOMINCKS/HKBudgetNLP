# HKBudgetNLP

A text summarization project for Hong Kong Budget Report 2020-21.

### Process:

#### 1. Data cleansing:

The Budget Report can be downloaded here:
    
    https://www.budget.gov.hk/2020/eng/pdf/2020-21%20Media%20Sheets.pdf

Data is cleaned into a txt file. It's time-saving to clean it manually rather than to use pdf2txt modules instead.



#### 2. Text Normalization

a. lower case, remove punctuations and trimming

b. tokenization

c. lemmatization

The list of part-of-speech tags used in NLTK:

In view of the tough economic environment and amid the challenges posed to Hong Kong by the social incidents and the novel coronavirus outbreak, the 2020-21 Budget has adopted an expansionary fiscal stance with a massive scale of counter-cyclical measures to help Hong Kong tide over the difficulties. The focus of this Budget is to “support enterprises, safeguard jobs, stimulate the economy and relieve people’s burden”. With an optimal use of the Government’s fiscal reserves, the Budget aims also to maintain the economy’s growth and vibrancy, promote social development, and rise to challenges in the future. 
It is estimated that the 2020-21 Budget, together with the additional helping measures introduced since August 2019, would have a stimulus effect on the Hong Kong economy of around 3% of GDP.
